#Notes: CS 260

##Git

I've learned about how to use version control through Git. It's really cool.

Imporant commands:
-`li` list files in directory
-`mkdir` make directory
-`pwd` present working directory
-`cd` change directory
-`git add`
-`git commit`
-`git push`
-`git pull`
-`git fetch`
-`git status`

If you need a reference to more commands visit the class page on the console and [Git](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/essentials/gitHub/gitHub.md#github).
